# Kalendar

Kalendar is a Kirigami-based calendar application that uses Akonadi. It lets you add, edit and delete events from local and remote accounts of your choice, while keeping changes syncronised across your Plasma desktop or phone.

**Kalendar is still under heavy development, and has no stable releases yet.** We do, however, welcome suggestions! Get involved and join our Matrix channel: #kalendar:kde.org

## Get it

Kalendar is available in the Arch AUR and with openSUSE tumbleweed using
the following two OBS repositories: https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:KaratekHD:kirigami
and https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:andresbs:plasma-mobile

Please note that this is pre-release software and that you may encounter bugs, crashes, or errors.

## Build

**Kalendar requires the kirigami-addons library to be installed, as well as KFrameworks 5.86 to be installed.** These packages may not be available in your distibution of choice, and Kalendar might not work. Additionally, **we recommend you install KOrganizer**, which will handle some aspects of the initial setup of Akonadi which Kalendar does not yet do.
