Most of this data has been imported from kdepim originally with the messagetreeparser.

To generate new gpg encrypted content use an existing mime message to your liking, and then
copy in ascii armored content in. The encrypted content can be created using:

    gpg2 --home /src/sink/mime/mimetreeparser/tests/gnupg_home/ -a -r test@kolab.org --encrypt toEncrypt.txt

where toEncrypt.txt contains the to be encrypted content.
